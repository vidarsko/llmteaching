# Good use cases of large language models

Large language models (LLMs) are versatile tools that can be used in a variety of contexts. Here are some examples.

## Making flow charts in LaTeX

Flow charts are a common way to represent processes and workflows.
They are used in a variety of contexts, including software development, business process modeling, and academic research.
Large language models can be used to generate such flow diagrams using TikZ in LaTeX.

## As a reverse dictionary

Ever had a word on the tip of your tongue but couldn't remember it?

As opposed to a normal dictionary, where you look up a word to find its meaning, a reverse dictionary allows you to describe a word and get a list of words that match that description.
Large language models are excellent for this.

## Hard-to-solve, easy-to-check problems

The above is a type of problem that is easy to check but hard to solve.
LLMs are excellent to use in such circumstances, because they can generate solutions that can be easily checked.
For example, it may be hard to formulate an answer to a question, but easy to check if a given answer is correct.
Or in coding, if you are looking for code to solve a specific problem, it may be hard to write the code, but easy to check if a given code snippet solves the problem.

## Change data formats

LLMs can be used to convert data from one format to another.
