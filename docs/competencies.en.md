# Competancies, learning outcomes and levels of achievements

Here are some of the learning objectives suitable for a course in LLMs.
The learning outcomes descibe what a student should be able to do after completing a course in using LLMs.

## C1: Explaining the technology

* Learning outcome: Explain and distinguish between the concepts of artificial intelligence, language models, neural networks, and training data, and discuss how training data can lead to biases in the responses given by language models.

| Low achievement | Medium achievement | High achievement |
|-----------------|--------------------|------------------|
| The student explains what AI is in a simple way.| The student explains the difference between AI and language models and can contextualize the concepts of neural networks and training data.| The student precisely explains the concepts of AI, language model, neural networks, and training data, and independently discusses how different training data can introduce bias in responses.|


## C2: Distinguishing between productive and unproductive use of language models

* Learning outcome: Discuss the difference between productive vs. unproductive applications of LLMs.

| Low achievement | Medium achievement | High achievement |
|-----------------|--------------------|------------------|
| The student expresses opinions on what is productive use of generative AI, but without justification. | The student distinguishes between productive and unproductive use of generative AI, with relevant examples. | The student defines precisely what distinguishes productive vs. unproductive use of generative AI, with relevant examples, and assesses the consequences of unproductive use. |

## C3: Using generative AI efficiently

* Learning outcome: Write effective prompts that include, if necessary, assigning a role to the language model, providing relevant context, examples, and a specific task.

| Low achievement | Medium achievement | High achievement |
|-----------------|--------------------|------------------|
| The student breaks complex tasks down to some degree and asks the language model to solve these. | The student provides the language model with context, examples, and specific tasks tailored to the topic. The student adjusts based on the responses from the language model and assigns new tasks accordingly. | The student assigns roles, context, and examples to the language model where relevant, and is able to formulate the task clearly and precisely. The student effectively adjusts these factors according to the responses from the language model. |

## C4: Evaluating the output from the language model

* Learning outcome: Critically evaluate the response given by the language model by cross-checking with other sources.

| Low achievement | Medium achievement | High achievement |
|-----------------|--------------------|------------------|
| The student simply accounts for why the response from the language model is not necessarily trustworthy. | The student accounts for cases in which one can trust the language model and cross-checks the answers with other sources. | The student evaluates the response given by the language model based on context, task, and purpose, and cross-checks the relevant parts of the answer with other sources. |

## Physics

* Learning outcome: Use the language model to implement physical equations and verify the solution against known cases.

| Low achievement | Medium achievement | High achievement |
|-----------------|--------------------|------------------|
| The student formulates a physical problem to the language model and gets the code to run in, for example, Colab. | The student formulates a physical problem, gets the code to run, and compares the solution with known cases. | The student formulates a physical problem, gets the code to run, compares the solution with known cases, and discusses the limitations of the language model in solving physical problems. |
