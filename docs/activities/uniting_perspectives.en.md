# Uniting diverse perspectives

Choose some physics phenomena that may seem counterintuitive. For example: 'Newton’s third law states that force equals counterforce in a collision,' 'It takes 8 minutes from when the sun ceases to exist until we notice anything at all,' and 'You cannot attach a magnet to a car to pull yourself forward.' Then have the students write down what they already know that makes these facts difficult to understand. For example: 'In a collision between a train and a car, it’s worse for the car,' 'When I turn off the light in the bathroom, I notice it immediately,' and 'I can lift things with magnets; it seems like magic.' Then ask the students to use the language model to reconcile these contradictions. Maybe you can outline the entire range in the space of meaning?
