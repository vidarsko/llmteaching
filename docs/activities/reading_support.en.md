# Reading support

Give the students a scientific article that is interesting (or let them find one themselves, if they are extra motivated). Copy the text content and paste it into a language model. Ask it to explain the article to you.

    Here is a physics article I found interesting:

    ```
    [paste article]
    ```

    I am a high-school physics student with only limited knowledge of physics. I would like you to explain this article to me in a pedagogical manner. I want you to answer my questions very briefly.

Notice how we have given the language model context, roles, and the format for how it should respond. The preference for brief answers is a personal choice
