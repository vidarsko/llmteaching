# Preparation for lab 

Laboratory work is often very difficult because there are many skills that need to be trained simultaneously: understanding of physics, technical skills, reading instructions, and calculating uncertainty. Therefore, it can be useful to set aside 30 minutes before the lab to paste the lab instructions into the language model and then ask it questions.

    I am supposed to do this laboratory experiment shortly. Here are the lab instructions:

    ```
    [paster lab instructions]
    ```

    I am a high school physics student with only limited knowledge of physics. I would like you to explain these lab instructions to me in a pedagogical manner. I want you to answer very briefly to my questions.
