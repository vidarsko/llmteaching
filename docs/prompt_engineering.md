# Principles of prompt engineering

Prompt engineering can be summarized in the acronym CRESTO.

# Context

One of the most important things when using a language model is to provide it with sufficient context.

# Role

Give yourself and/or it a clear role. "I am very bad at programming, explain it to me in a simple way" or "You are an extremely skilled educator."

# Examples

Provide examples of how you want the answer, or what kind of ideas you want it to come up with.

# Scope 

Tell the language model what field you are in and what it should stick to. If you know approximately where the solution to your problem lies, inform it of this.

# Task

Most importantly, give it a precise task.

# Output format

Tell the language model how you want your answer: as a bullet list? Table? Poem?
