# Debate 
Choose a topic within physics that is suitable for debate. For example, 'strengths and weaknesses of Bohr's atomic model' or 'quantum mechanics vs. general relativity - which is better,' and divide the class into two groups. Then ask the students to spend 30 minutes with the language model to prepare for the debate, for example by having it generate counterarguments.
