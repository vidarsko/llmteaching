# Computational essays

Differentiation is key in programming tasks. Let students explore a physical phenomenon using programming and state that what they have discovered should be presented in front of the class or submitted as a Google Colab notebook. It may not be obvious what it means to explore a physical phenomenon using programming, but a starting point could be to look at this collection of so-called 'Computational essays'. Give students several options:

Create a simulation of a double pendulum in Python (have a working minimal example on hand in case some students are struggling to get started). Find a question you're curious about regarding the pendulum's motion (e.g., when does the motion transition to become 'chaotic') and create a presentation where you compile what you have found.
Simulate a throw with air resistance! Find an interesting question and create a presentation on what you have discovered.
Find your own physical system and question. Create a presentation on what you have found.
